# Introduction üõ´
Hello There! üëãüèæ
This is a repository I created in order to do some simple tasks for practice during my first year of coding in C. üòÅ

# What Does It Entail? üßê
Some of the topics I learnt and brief explanations for anyone who comes across it.
All of the projects on here except the folder are some questions I wrote down while watching youtube videos in order to learn as I code.

# Conclusion üèÅ
This is my first step into the world of coding and despite the numerous missed semi colons üòÇ, the countless hours looking for one small error that can be found with difficulty üòî and the painstaking thinking and white boarding with my stuffed duck üåö, this has been and continues to be a blast.
I hope each and every one of you can experience the bliss that comes with coding and the euphoric feeling of getting a perfectly working code. üíª
Thank you for visiting my profile. üôèüèæ

HAPPY CODING !!!!! üéâüéâüéâ
